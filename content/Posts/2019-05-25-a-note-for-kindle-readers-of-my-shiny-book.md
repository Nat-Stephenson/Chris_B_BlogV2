title: A note for Kindle readers of my Shiny book
---

Someone has been in touch with me to say that the Kindle version has no chapter numbers and they were finding it difficult to figure out which bit of the book went with which bit in the repository.

I’ve made a little video just to run through all the chapters and which code file goes with which bit of the book. While I was doing it I noticed the minimal example from chapter 2 is missing. It’s only small so I don’t think anybody will be too bothered about typing it but I’ve put it on [a Gist](https://gist.github.com/ChrisBeeley/8924a0bfc1fc7853e7a7b859a2a133f0) anyway.

Hopefully that should resolve any problems with the book and the code, do let me know if not, on here or just DM me @chrisbeeley on Twitter.

The video is here:
