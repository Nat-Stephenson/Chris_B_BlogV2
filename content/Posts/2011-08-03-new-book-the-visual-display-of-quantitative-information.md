Took delivery of a new book today, Tufte’s Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Obviously it’s a classic but I had no idea what a beautiful book it is. Camera doesn’t do it justice:

Full of wonderful illustrations from throughout the ages as well.

I’ll cover this and some of my favourite books past and present in future posts.
