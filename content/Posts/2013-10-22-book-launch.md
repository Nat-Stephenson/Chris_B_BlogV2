My book has just come out, [Web Application Development with R using Shiny](http://www.packtpub.com/web-application-development-with-r-using-shiny/book). It’s an introduction to the marvellous [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) from the wonderful people at RStudio. Although the online documentation for Shiny does cover most of the things you might want to do with it the people who approached me about writing the book thought that having a more comprehensive guide with some worked examples would be useful. And I was inclined to agree. So I wrote the book in 3 months, which was one of the most brilliant and awful experiences of my entire life.

As I mentioned in a previous post, a lot of the code I wrote for the book lives on GitHub, links from my [website](http://chrisbeeley.net/website/). I also host all the applications on my server, so you can play with the actual applications themselves, again links are on the site.

The book takes you all the way from beginning with R, all the way through very basic examples of Shiny, and on through using HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript/ jQuery with Shiny, and various advanced functions like controlling reactivity, uploading and downloading files, all that kind of thing.

It’s a very humble contribution, really, but I would definitely have bought, read and used it when I was starting out, so I hope it goes some way to helping people use Shiny, which really to me represents a complete game-changer in the way that you can write a halfway decent application to let anybody explore your data in a *morning*.
