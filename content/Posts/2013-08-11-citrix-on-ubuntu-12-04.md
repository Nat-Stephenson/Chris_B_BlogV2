title: Citrix on Ubuntu 12.04

One for Linux users forced to use Citrix to log in to their corporate email, such as myself. I’d long given up trying to get Citrix to work on Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop, but a recent success with 13.04 on my main computer led me to have another go. I followed the instructions here <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CitrixICAClientHowTo>, got some weird error message, followed the instructions here [http://forums.citrix.com/thread.jspa?threadID=306353&amp;tstart=0](http://forums.citrix.com/thread.jspa?threadID=306353&tstart=0) and BOOM, I was in.

That’s Linux’s super-awesome hot breath you can feel on your neck, Windoze.
