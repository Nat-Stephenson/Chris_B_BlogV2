title: Better Git commit messages
---

Something else I’m trying to be better at is using Git. I did use it, briefly, a few years back but I never quite got the hang of it and I’ve reverted to the bad habit of having MainCode/ and TestingCode/ and TryNewFunction/ folders filled with near identical code.

So I’m back on the Git wagon again. Atom (see my [previous blog post](http://chrisbeeley.net/?p=1023)) has beautiful Git integration, as you’d expect since it was built by the GitHub people. It also enforces a couple of conventions with writing Git commit messages, which inspired me on a Google search which led me to this, [a guide to writing better commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

I never even thought about the art of it, but, of course, like code comments, good commit messages are essential for collaborating with anyone, even your future self.
