title: Font size of code in .Rpres presentations
---

I don’t know if I even knew about the [.Rpres presentation feature](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/sections/200130218-R-Presentations) in RStudio v. 0.98 and above. As I think I mentioned I’ve been rather ill for the last couple of years and I’m afraid I kind of fell out of touch with things a bit. Anyway, I’m all better now and I’m going to be giving a talk at the [R User Group in Nottingham](https://www.meetup.com/NottinghamR-Nottingham-R-Users-Group/) (which I love profoundly) so I thought I’d do it this new sexy way.

It seems pretty handy, haven’t made the whole presentation yet so I’m sure there’s more to come but the first thing is, dang! The code in an echo = TRUE chunk is really large! I can’t fit any output on the page!

So I found [this guide to making it smaller](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/27777_55697c3a476640caa0ad2099fe914ae5.html#/), and lots of other nice tweaks, too.
