title: Shoddy data
---

You know, naming no names because I’ll get in trouble but someone somewhere has paid for some data from a proprietary vendor and they’re shipping absolutely unusable garbage data.

They won’t fix it because “no-one else has complained”.

HAVE SOME PRIDE IN WHAT YOU’RE DOING. How about that? How about fixing it because it’s an embarrassment? I’m a random idiot in some random NHS Trust in the countryside and I couldn’t sleep if my database looked like what you’re sending.

I swear on my life the NHS could do 99% of this stuff better itself if we just dug in and had a go. Everyone’s in thrall to these people with expensive watches and glossy brochures but it’s all a confidence trick.
