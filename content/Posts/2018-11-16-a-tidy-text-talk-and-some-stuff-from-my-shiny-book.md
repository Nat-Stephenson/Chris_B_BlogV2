title: A tidy text talk and some stuff from my Shiny book
---

This is just a quick post to show some of the stuff that I’ve published/ presented/ put on GitHub recently.

So my Shiny book, Web Application Development with R using Shiny, 3rd edition, is out, and I’ve forked the code from the publisher’s repository onto my own GitHub to make it easier to find.

And I’ve got another book about Shiny out which is all about UI development with Shiny, and I’ve forked the code from that onto my GitHub, too

I’ve also put the talk I did about text processing at the Nottingham useR onto my GitHub as well.
