title: My PhD thesis is online finally
url: /?p=590

To my great shame, I never published the findings from my PhD (Daily behavioural ratings: what can behavioural observation tell us about psychopathy, personality disorder and violence risk in secure psychiatric settings?) in any journals, by the time Iâ€™d finished I was so busy with my new job that I just never got round to it.

The least I can do is host the thesis on my server in case it proves of use to anyone, and I have added it to my [website](http://chrisbeeley.net/website/) today, link to file [here](http://chrisbeeley.net/website/ChrisBeeleyThesis_WithCorrections.pdf).
