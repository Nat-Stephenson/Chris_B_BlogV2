title: Digikam crashes on startup

To be honest, this post is really designed as a reminder to me in case I ever reinstall my OS, but it will probably get a bit of Google juice and could possibly help somebody else.

If youâ€™re using [Digikam](https://www.digikam.org/) (a fine piece of software for organising your photos, well worth a look) and you find that it crashes on startup with Linux Mint, then

```
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">

sudo apt-get install kdelibs-bin kdelibs5-data kdelibs5-plugins

```
