title: Amazing video- Inventing on principle
url: /?p=182
---

I’ve just seen an amazing video, Brett Victor talking about [Inventing on Principle.](http://vimeo.com/36579366)

It should be of great interest to programmers and creatives and indeed anyone who needs or wants to come up with new and exciting ideas (everyone, in other words). If you’re not a programmer, stick with the video because he broadens out the discussion a lot a third of the way in. And if you are, just get stuck in and watch. You won’t regret it.
