title: Some examples of Shiny with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery

It’s becoming rather [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/)-centric, this blog, I know, but I just put some little demos about how to use Shiny with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, just some toy examples with links to source, up on the [website](http://chrisbeeley.net/website/).

So if you’re interested in Shiny go have a look. Each has a link to the interactive version and the source. Do note that there are easier/ better ways of doing some of these things (row highlighting can be done in CSS rather than jQuery, e.g.); these are really just for educational purposes.
