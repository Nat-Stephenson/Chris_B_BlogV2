title: New Year&#8217;s post
---

So this is my annual New Yearâ€™s post, itâ€™s an idea from David Allen that Iâ€™ve done [before](https://chrisbeeley.net/?p=1052).

2018 was the year that I was finally (pretty much) better. I had my bowel and spleen removed in August 2017 and bled in quite a scary way, but by the time 2018 rolled around I was running 9 miles, building mileage ready for a marathon in May. Itâ€™s been a great year. I did have some pretty scary health problems (that I wonâ€™t go into) but it all worked out in the finish and Iâ€™m pretty much back to working and being happy with my family just as I was all the way back in 2014 before everything started to go wrong.

So the first big news of 2018 was I got a new job (March). Iâ€™m now half time in my old job, and half time in the new one. They both link together, in that I do Shiny code and server admin to facilitate several dashboards that we use for staff and patient experience and some clinical stuff too. Iâ€™m absolutely loving both jobs. Weâ€™re doing a lot of stuff that is pretty new in the NHS, weâ€™re the first Trust that Iâ€™m aware of with a Shiny Pro licence, and Iâ€™ve talked to people all over the country about what weâ€™re doing. My Trust is very supportive and itâ€™s all going really well.

I suppose my next big thing was running a marathon in May. It wasnâ€™t as fast as I would have liked (four hours and thirty three minutes), but I did have quite a few pretty serious problems with being ill so I did pretty well considering. Iâ€™ve got another one in 2019, more on which later. Next up was the British Transplant Games (July). It was my first time competing and I won bronze at 5K and 1500m, which was very nice. My big goal now is to qualify for the world games, Iâ€™m guessing silver would be enough to do that, partly depends on the time I guess, too.

For the first time in my life I have a savings account, which is absolutely great, and Iâ€™m trying (and failing) to save three times my salary by February 2019. My wife and kids are a lot happier now Iâ€™m better, we all really went through hell so itâ€™s been a great year just doing normal stuff you canâ€™t do when youâ€™re ill, like go abroad.

And the most recent thing thatâ€™s exciting is starting the data science accelerator. I keep meaning to blog more about it, Iâ€™m overbusy just doing it, but thereâ€™s a GitHub with some of the first steps on [here](https://github.com/ChrisBeeley/naturallanguageprocessing). Text analysis is really easy to do, and really hard to do well, so Iâ€™m really glad that Iâ€™ve got a mentor to guide me through it. Iâ€™m working really hard trying to build some robust analysis and hopefully deploy some sort of reusable pipeline that other NHS Trusts can use. Iâ€™ve been dabbling in Python, too, which I really want to do more of. I feel like having other languages could help me build more and better stuff more easily. Iâ€™ve really bought into the whole agile development thing, as well, thatâ€™s a part of the accelerator, and one of the talks by a product manager was fascinating.

So thatâ€™s it for 2018. Iâ€™m starting 2019 strong. Very strong. My health was a teensy bit wobbly this time last year but Iâ€™m as strong as an ox at the moment. It really feels good after being frightened and weak for such a long time. At work I want to tie up all the threads and be a part of an agile data science team, producing robust statistical analyses using interactive web based technologies (like Shiny!).

Oh yes! That reminds me. Of course last year I also wrote [a book](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/web-application-development-r-using-shiny-third-edition) and I started teaching statistics to Trust staff- advanced stuff in 12 one hour tutorials and a quick review in a 2 and a half hour lecture. The teaching has been going really well, Iâ€™ve been getting a lot of good feedback and Iâ€™m really hoping it helps my Trust do better with the data it collects.

I live a blessed life. All I want to do in 2019 is keep doing the same stuff I already do and love. Run a faster marathon (sub 4 hour). Get a silver medal. Be part of a bigger, better data science team. Keep doing all the stuff weâ€™re doing with Shiny and text analysis and help other Trusts to do it, too. And more than anything else I want my family to just live a normal life and forget about all that stuff between 2015-2017.

Oh yeah. And I want to solve the Rubikâ€™s cube, too. My eldest got one for Christmas and itâ€™s got me hooked.

Thatâ€™s me for 2019. Good luck with whatever youâ€™ve got on your plate for the year ðŸ™‚
